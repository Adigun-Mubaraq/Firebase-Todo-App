# Firebase-Todo-App
Firebase-Todo-App is a simple mobile application built with React Native and Firebase. The app allows users to create, update, and delete todo items. It uses Firebase's real-time database to update the list of todos in real-time, making the app more responsive and user-friendly.

### Getting Started:
To use the app, you need to set up a Firebase account and configure your project. After that, you can clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using the package manager of your choice. You can then start the app using Expo, either on an emulator or on your mobile device.
